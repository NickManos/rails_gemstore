#Nicholas' Amazing Gem Store

This gem store is based on Codeschool's AngularJS course. Assisted by Gabe
Khofri.

It is a storefront for selling gems with the ability to add new gems as JSON objects, view their description,
specs, and post reviews from different tabs all updated using angular controllers and directives for lighting
fast responsiveness.
